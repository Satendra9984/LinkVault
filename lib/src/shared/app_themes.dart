  A secondary color provides more ways to accent and distinguish your product. Having a secondary color is optional, and should be applied sparingly to accent select parts of your UI.

  If you donâ€™t have a secondary color, your primary color can also be used to accent elements.

  Secondary colors are best for:

  Floating action buttons
  Selection controls, like sliders and switches
  Highlighting selected text
  Progress bars
  Links and headlines
